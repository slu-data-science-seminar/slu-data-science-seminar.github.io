Please join us for another installment of our occasional [brownbag series](/brownbags/). [Srikanth Mudigonda, Ph.D.](https://www.slu.edu/online/contact-us/faculty/srikanth-mudigonda.php), the Director of the [M.S. in Applied Analytics](https://www.slu.edu/programs/graduate/applied-analytics-ms.php), will be giving a short overview of how to use Python via RStudio (and why you might want to!). The upcoming release of RStudio v1.2 integrates fully into Python, and includes the ability to mix Python and `R` code in `R` markdown documents.

This will be the DSS's second Python related lesson and is being used to help us develop a plan for offering Python content moving forward. If you are interested in using Python for data science, please join us in helping build this community at SLU!

**Where: 3600 Morrissey Hall**

**When: Wednesday, April 17th from 1pm to 3pm**
