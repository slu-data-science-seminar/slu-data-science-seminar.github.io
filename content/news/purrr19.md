Please join us for another installment of our occasional [brownbag series](/brownbags/). [Srikanth Mudigonda, Ph.D.](https://www.slu.edu/online/contact-us/faculty/srikanth-mudigonda.php), the Director of the [M.S. in Applied Analytics](https://www.slu.edu/programs/graduate/applied-analytics-ms.php), will be giving a short overview of techniques for iterating in `R` using the most modern, `tidyverse`-centric approach - `purrr`. 

The `purrr` package offers a powerful interface for repeating the same task over observations, variables, or over pieces of information stored in vectors or lists. It can be used to read in a large number of spreadsheets and collapse them automatically into a single sheet, search strings for a list of different words, and iterate over observations. If you've ever used loops or the apply family of functions and want to level-up your game, or if iteration has seemed intimidating in the past, this brownbag is for you!
