## Overview
This past [October](/news/meetup18/), we brought the open science community at SLU together for a gathering to discuss where we're at and where we could be. On March 29th, we're taking a next step towards a broader, more inclusive data science and open community here at SLU. 

One thing that we've learned is many computational researchers describe feeling like "islands of one". The spring data science meetup will therefore feature a faculty lighting talk session for faculty and staff researchers engaged in data science and computational work (lunch provided) followed by a coffee break. The second portion of the event will feature two speakers - Jenine Harris (founder of `R`-Ladies St. Louis / Washington University) and Joshua Ulrich (data scientist and organizer of the St. Louis `R` User Group). Jenine and Josh will be speaking about building community around data science. Jenine will also highlight issues related to diversity in data science communities. Their short talks will serve as a springboard for an interactive discussion and a closing reception.

## Call for Lightning Talk Proposals
We are currently accepting proposals for the lightning talks from SLU faculty and staff researchers. These will be three to four minutes long and include only one slide. We are open to any topic so long as it highlights how you are using data science (broadly defined) in your work. The aim of these talks is to allow for the audience to begin to break down the barriers creating "islands of one" by identifying potential collaborators and intersections of research interests. 

If you are interested in presenting during the lightning talk session, please provide a title for your lighting talk with your RSVP. Please submit your RSVP form by Friday, March 1st. Depending on interest, we may not be able to accommodate all proposals. Everyone who submits a proposal will be notified of acceptance on Monday, March 4th.
