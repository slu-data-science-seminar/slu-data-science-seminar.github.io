Please join us for another installment of our occasional [brownbag series](/brownbags/). The DSS and the Department of Psychology's E-tea group are jointly sponsoring this event, which will include an overview of open science techniques and a discussion of how to implement them in your work. We'll be talking about how to make code and data shareable and citable, using the Open Science Framework, and depositing pre-prints in repositories.

**Where: Location TBD**

**When: April 2nd, 2:15pm to 3:30pm**
